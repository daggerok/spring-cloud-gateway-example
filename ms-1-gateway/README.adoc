=== step 1: gateway

This is a first step in micro-services migration process.
First of all we need create entry point of our future system -- application gateway.
Gateway will forward any requests to proper services of your system.

Gateway server is using port: 8002

.gateway routes configuration:
[source,java]
----
include::./src/main/java/daggerok/gateway/GatewayApplication.java[tags=content]
----

this configuration shows how we can forward every request to monolith (except itself actuator requests)
